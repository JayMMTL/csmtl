# CS MTL Community website
### Built with Gatsby + Netlify CMS Starter

The original example site can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms). It was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org): **[Demo Link](https://gatsby-netlify-cms.netlify.com/)**.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

## The project
A non-profit community, Customer Success Montreal organizes events where industry leaders present and participants can build their professional network. The initial build of the website should be live by July 7th.
