I attended the Customer Success Summit in Toronto a few weeks ago. It was a great opportunity to network with other CS professionals, that's where I met Peter Armaly, the speaker of our first event last year. Speakers brought an interesting perspective to challenges common to most CS orgs and I left the conference with some ideas to increase the impact my team has in my company.

## Key Takeaways

Startups and Fortune 500 CS orgs have common challenges:

* Data (instrumentation, tracking, data silos)
* Cross-team alignment (handoffs, objectives, accountability, executive buy-in)
* Adoption of customer-centric vision/mission 

We'll be diving in to these topics in future posts. 

## Stats & Numbers

**The Experience Gap:** 80% of companies believe they are delivering on customer expectations, 8% of their customers agree (source [Bain: Closing the delivery gap](http://www2.bain.com/bainweb/pdfs/cms/hotTopics/closingdeliverygap.pdf))

**SAP CS team is a major profit centre:** the revenue they generate through upsell, renewals, c-suite references rolodex,... pay substantially more than the whole department costs (salaries, expenses, travel...)

**Studies show a 40% difference in churn when companies focus on ease of communicating** vs. “playing hard to reach”. Enter Chatbots.

**67% of customers are willing to pay more for an enhanced experience**
